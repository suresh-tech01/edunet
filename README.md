Steganography-Based Secret Message Encoding and Decoding System

Background: With increasing concerns over data privacy and secure communication, traditional encryption methods are widely used. However, encrypted messages can attract attention, leading to potential security risks. Steganography offers a solution by hiding messages inside ordinary files, such as images, making the existence of hidden information undetectable.

Problem: How can we develop a steganography-based system that allows users to securely hide and retrieve text messages within digital images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, ensuring confidentiality without altering the visible image quality?

Objectives:

Develop a Python-based application that allows users to:
Hide a secret message inside an image. Retrieve the hidden message from the modified image.

Implement Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography for minimal distortion of the image.
Ensure ease of use through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
Support multiple image formats while ensuring data security.
Expected Outcome: A functional software tool that embeds secret messages within images. A reliable decoding system that extracts the hidden message without data loss. Improved data confidentiality while maintaining the original appearance of the image
